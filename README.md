# iota-archive-longitude
This is an IOTA loader project. It reads data from IOTA Node's ZMQ port and writes it to data repository. The data repository is backed by SQL or NewSQL database.
Three goals underpin this project: simplicity, high availability, and high throughput. The loader shall be ready to scale when the tangle reaches thousands of tps.
